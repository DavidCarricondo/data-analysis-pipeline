# data-analysis-pipeline
Ironhack project. Creating a data pipeline using database, API requests, and web scrapping.

BY default, the program should return a report with the means and distribution of some parameters of the whole song dataset and divide by genres
With a band name, it will produce a report with a comparision of the most popular song by that group compared to the rest of the songs 
and to the genres summary. It also produces a bio of the band and other similar bands
THe lyric argument shows the lyric of the song if available in the specific API
The picture argument returns a picture of a band retrieved from web scrapping.
